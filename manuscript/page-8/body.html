        <h2> Fierce Opposition </h2>
        <p>
            In Arvind's birthchart the Sun rules his 4<sup>th</sup> house of <em>sukh bhav</em> (the house of happiness) indicating a bright political future ahead. It also represents radiance and strength implying upliftment of masses (poor and suppressed) along with a deep seated love for the motherland taking him closer to powers at the center. Arvind will succeed in all his political goals. </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, the opposing relationship between Jupiter and Sun in its current dasha of the 4<sup>th</sup> house indicates multiple obstacles ahead, especially from media and opposition who'll drive several false campaigns to defame him by posing as his friends. This is something Arvind Kejriwal has had to face for sometime and will continue to do so up until 2020 when the planet Jupiter, the lord the 8<sup>th</sup> house (of scandals and fame), aligns with the Sun and doubles his ability to thwart his rivals easily.
