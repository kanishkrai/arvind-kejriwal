            Sun rules the 4th house of Sukh Bhav, Motherland and as a natural malefic planet with a fiery temperament offers a major role in the conjunction. Sun represents the Government, Government Favors and as its malefic influence and ownership of the 4th house of Motherland and harmony possibly indicates about the clash of opinions with the Government and getting less favours from Government too.
