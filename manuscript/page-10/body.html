            Jupiter's Mahadasa will be ending on August 2020. The coming Mahadasa of Saturn according to his birthchart, in reference to its placement indicates a major shift of view and attitude of the working class of the country as Saturn represents the working class.

            Since, Saturn is debilitated in Lagna and D9 chart, this debilitation of Saturn shows its inability to favour Mr. Kejiriwal in its Period for PM elections, unless and until he comes with a remarkable solution for the obstacles and problems faced by the working class in his tenure as CM.
