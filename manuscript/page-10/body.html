        <h2> Future of AAP </h2>
        <p>
            AAP symbolizes the <em>Aam Aadmi</em> or the common man. In similar vein, from an astrological standpoint AAP represents the kundali of the common man. Yes, the AAP political party has a kundali of its own, which we would analyze separately sometime in the future, but for now, it is safe to assume that AAP's destiny is intertwined with that of Arvind Kejriwal and other party leaders such as Manish Sisodia and Sanjay Singh.

        <p>
            It is noteworthy here to mention that AAP started as a grassroots movement and has turned into a political force to reckon with. Like any other startup out there, AAP too has its own limitations and troubles. It shows a promise of growth but lacks the experience or deep pockets or corporate funding that could easily turn it into a full blown political party.
