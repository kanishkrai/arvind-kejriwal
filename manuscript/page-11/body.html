        <h2> Future of AAP </h2>
        <p>
            AAP symbolizes the <em>Aam Aadmi</em> or the common man. Saturn, which is in a sad state due to its debilitation in D9 Destiny chart. Thus, AAP has to bring simple yet effective policies regarding the common man with least obstacles involved, for pacification of Saturn or making the working class smile with gratitude.
        </p>
        <p>
        Arvind Kejriwal has tried to apply policies like Odd-Even forumula of transportation, E-Ration Card, launch of fast track courts for fast implementation of law and policies regarding proper development of Schools and hospitals in an innovative way in his term as CM.
        </p>
        <p>
            These policies can help the common man will only favour its coming to power in the Period of Saturn or for its own sustenance. Otherwise, the inner conflicts would cost the ideology of incorruptible AAP.
