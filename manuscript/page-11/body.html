        <h2> Future of AAP </h2>
        <p>
            AAP symbolizes the <em>Aam Aadmi</em> or the common man. Saturn, which is in a sad state due to its debilitation in D9 Destiny chart. Though they had right issues to target in the previous Punjab and Goa elections, yet they failed get people's mandate. 
        </p>
        <p>
        AAP grossly underestimated the opposition due to Kejriwal's malefic Sun which lead to pompous attitude and power tripping. With Saturn decided the fate of Karma, they were humbled in the elections and the party decided to reorganize themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, AAP has to bring simple yet effective policies regarding the common man with least obstacles involved, for pacification of Saturn or making the working class smile with gratitude.
