        <h2> Future of AAP </h2>
        <p>
            AAP symbolizes the <em>Aam Aadmi</em> or the common man, which points to the placement of representation of Common Man. Saturn, which is in a Sad state due to its Debilitation in D9 Destiny chart. Thus, AAP has to bring simple yet effective policies regarding the common man with least obstacles involved, for pacification of Saturn or making  the working class smile with gratitude.
        </p>
        <p>
            These policies which can help the common man can only and will only favour its coming to power in the Period of Saturn or for its own sustenance.
