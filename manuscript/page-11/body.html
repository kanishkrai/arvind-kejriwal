            AAP's position in political arena will grow only stronger as Jupiter's <em>mahadasha</em> will come to an end by August 2020. The coming <em>mahadasa</em> of Saturn according to Arvind Kejriwal's birthchart, in reference to its placement indicates a major shift of view and attitude of the working class of India as the planet Saturn represents the working class.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since Saturn is debilitated in his lagna and D9 chart, the current political crises and challenges will test the Aam Aadmi Party upto its grassroots volunteers and prepare them for general elections better. It goes without saying that the yog for Arvind Kejriwal to become the Primeminister of India is strong but it will depend completely on AAP's ability to produce remarkable and innovative solutions for the problems faced by the working classes.
        </p>
        <p> Overall, AAP has a major role to play in left-center politics and will successfully represent the poor and the downtrodden.
